If you decied to recompile these yourself then I would recomend using tensorflow gpu
Libaries:   Tensorflow-gpu,
            keras,
            numpy,
            pillow,
            pandas,
            matplotlib,
            cv2,
            vgg16,
            vggface

The order that I did these in was: 
                                    keras basics,
                                    example of linear regression,
                                    natural images,
                                    face reognition,
                                    live face cam
                                    
                                   
                                   
Example of face recognition.
