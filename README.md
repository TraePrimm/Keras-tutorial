If you decied to recompile these yourself then I would recomend using tensorflow gpu
Libaries:   Tensorflow-gpu
            keras
            numpy
            pillow
            pandas
            matplotlib
            cv2
            vgg16
            vggface

The order that I did these in was: 
                                    keras basics
                                    example of linear regression
                                    natural images
                                    face reognition
                                    live face cam
